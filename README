This module allows to generate fiscal receipt in the proper legal format in France

It alters the default workflow at several places

1) before saving a contribution, it checks (based on the status) if the receipt has to be generated

if it's not the case, it empties the receipt_date
if the receipt has to be generated

- It generates a unique id for each receipt (YYYY-id) and puts it into the invoice_id
- It sets the receipt_date

2) it alters the mail sent after confirmation to replace the default attachement by the fiscal receipt. 

3) it alters the contribution view to add a "generate receipt" button and one "resend receipt"
The former generates a pdf to download, the later sends it directly to the user and logs the mail sent

Cela permet aux associations loi 1901 déclarées d'intérêt public de générer les reçus fiscaux au titre de dons.

## Initialisation

You need to set the counter for the invoice references (one per year, probably only for the current year needed

drush variable-get tttp_receipt_2012 
drush variable-set tttp_receipt_2012 42


If you want to reset the invoice id (it might be read only on the UI): use the api explorer
/civicrm/api/explorer#/civicrm_staging/civicrm/ajax/rest?json=1&debug=1&version=3&entity=Contribution&action=create&id=42&invoice_id=&

Where 42 is the number of the contrib you want to alter

## Implementation details and hacks

It is using the invoice_id to store the tax receipt number
It is using the "thank you" date as date the receipt was generated.

##Update of the database to bulk update of single donations:

Check how many are waiting:
select count(*)  from civicrm_contribution as
c,civicrm_value_wikimedia_donations_1 where entity_id=c.id and
recu_fiscal_1=1 and contribution_type_id = 3 and
contribution_status_id = 1 and thankyou_date is null;

update civicrm_contribution as c,civicrm_value_wikimedia_donations_1
set thankyou_date = "1971-01-01 01:01:00" where entity_id=c.id and
recu_fiscal_1=1 and contribution_type_id = 3 and
contribution_status_id = 1 and thankyou_date is null;

## update of the database for the SEPA (recurring) contrib

select id from (SELECT id,min(receive_date) from civicrm_contribution where contribution_recur_id is not null AND thankyou_date is null AND contribution_status_id = 1 group by contact_id ) as first_sepa_contrib;

update civicrm_contribution set thankyou_date = "1971-01-01 01:01:00" where id in ( select id from (SELECT id,min(receive_date) from civicrm_contribution where contribution_recur_id is not null AND thankyou_date is null AND contribution_status_id = 1 group by contact_id ) as first_sepa_contrib );
